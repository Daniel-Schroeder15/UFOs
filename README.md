# UFOs

UFO sightings have been recorded on a data file (data.js). I have created a dynamic webpage displaying the data from the file. The webpage allows for someone to filter the dataset by multiple coloumns. JavaScript and HTML was used to create, style, and imput images for the multiple filter webpage. The webpage created was developed with the help of Boostrap Grid System and D3 (JavaScript Library). 

Recommendation for the webpage: 
The filter could only be limitied to what is available in the data.js file. This means thats you could only choose from a certain menu.
I would also include a message inside the table to say, "No current UFO sighting" if there is no current data match.
